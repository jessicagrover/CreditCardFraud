The analysis involves detecting credit card fraud using various machine learning models. The dataset consists of 284,807 transactions, with only 492 labeled as fraud. Preprocessing includes scaling and balancing the data. Models such as Logistic Regression, Shallow Neural Network, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine are trained and evaluated. Logistic Regression and Shallow Neural Network achieve high accuracy, with the latter showing improved recall for fraud cases. RandomForest, Gradient Boosting, and SVM also perform well but with slightly lower recall scores for fraud. Finally, the dataset is balanced for improved model performance.
